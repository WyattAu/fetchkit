# Threat Model — fetchkit

Reference: STRIDE. Scope: the crate's public API surface (`Client`,
`ClientBuilder`, `RequestBuilder`, `FetchError`) as used by a downstream
service. Trust boundaries: (1) URLs and header strings entering builder
methods, (2) responses (status, body, headers) crossing back into the
caller's error handling, (3) the dependency tree (reqwest, reqwest-middleware,
reqwest-retry, rustls/native-tls per feature).

## Assets

| ID | Asset | Example |
|----|-------|---------|
| A1 | Confidentiality of credentials passed to requests | Bearer token or basic-auth password leaked into logs |
| A2 | Integrity of request destination (no unintended hosts) | Base-URL confusion sends an authenticated request to the wrong host |
| A3 | Availability of the caller (no hangs, no unbounded retries) | Wedged peer or retry storm ties up worker tasks |

## STRIDE Analysis

| # | Threat | Category | Surface | Mitigation | Verifying test |
|---|--------|----------|---------|------------|----------------|
| T1 | Requests hang forever on a wedged peer | DoS | all request methods | Default 30 s total timeout on every built client; per-request override via `RequestBuilder::timeout`; retries capped (default 3) with bounded exponential backoff (`retry_bounds`) | `client_builder_default_timeout`, `client_builder_default_retries`, `client_builder_retry_bounds`, `client_builder_timeout_zero` |
| T2 | Base-URL confusion / open redirect into credentials | Spoofing | `resolve_url`, `base_url` | Resolution is plain concatenation: base is trimmed of trailing `/`, path of leading `/`; a *full* URL passed with a base set is still appended to the base (never a bare redirect to an attacker host). No automatic cross-host following beyond reqwest defaults | `url_resolution_base_with_relative_path`, `url_resolution_full_url_with_base`, `url_resolution_base_multiple_trailing_slashes`, `url_resolution_empty_path_with_base` |
| T3 | Credential leakage through error values | Info disclosure | `FetchError` | **Not mitigated** — `FetchError::StatusCode` embeds the raw response body and `Network` embeds the underlying message; `Debug`/`Display` render them fully. Credentials themselves are never stored by the client (headers live only in the request), so the crate cannot leak them — but caller bodies echoed in errors may be sensitive. Documented residual risk | `fetch_error_status_code_display`, `fetch_error_debug_format` (assert full rendering, i.e. no redaction) |
| T4 | Invalid header/URL input panics | DoS | `ClientBuilder::default_header`, `build()` | Documented, deliberate panics: `default_header` rejects invalid `&'static str` at construction (caller programming error); `build()` documents its panic as process-startup defect and `try_build()` is the fallible alternative | `client_builder_default_header` (valid path); `client_builder_try_build_success`; panic contracts documented on both methods |
| T5 | Plaintext/HTTP downgrade | Elevation | `reqwest_builder` escape hatch | **Not mitigated** — the raw `reqwest::ClientBuilder` passthrough lets callers disable TLS or relax defaults; no allow-list of schemes. Documented residual risk: TLS policy is caller-owned | Code review |
| T6 | Fallback sends the request to the wrong endpoint on transient failure | Tampering | `fetch_with_fallback` | Documented semantics: *any* primary failure (including 4xx) triggers the fallback fetch; the fallback result is authoritative. No signature binding between primary and fallback responses | Not covered by a dedicated test — documented residual risk |

## Repudiation

The crate performs no logging and keeps no audit trail (stateless wrapper).
Request/response evidence lives entirely in the caller's stack. Accepted —
a client library is the wrong layer for audit.

## Out of Scope

- TLS configuration, certificate pinning, and proxy policy: delegated to
  reqwest via `reqwest_builder`.
- Response body size limits: `json()`/`text()` will buffer whatever the
  server sends; hostile-server memory exhaustion is not defended here.
- SSRF policy: whether a URL is safe to request is a caller decision; the
  crate resolves strings, it does not judge destinations.
- Auth token lifetime/refresh: `bearer_auth` takes any `Display` and
  attaches it verbatim.

## Residual Risks

- **R1 (Medium, accepted):** Error values echo server-controlled bodies
  (T3). A malicious server can inject log-forging content (newlines, ANSI)
  into `FetchError` rendering. Callers should treat `FetchError` text as
  untrusted in logs.
- **R2 (Low, accepted):** Naive base/path concatenation (T2) means a path
  like `../admin` is passed through unnormalized — no dot-segment removal.
  Callers building URLs from user input must normalize first.
- **R3 (Low, accepted):** Retry defaults apply to any transient middleware
  classification; a flaky authenticated endpoint receives up to 4 requests.
  `retries(0)` is available and tested (`client_builder_retries_zero`).
- **R4 (Low, accepted):** Dependency risk in reqwest/hyper stack; no
  in-repo `cargo audit` gate (org-level Dependabot only).
